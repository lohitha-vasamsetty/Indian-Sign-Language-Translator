# Indian-Sign-Language-Translator

The Indian Sign Language Translator is an innovative and user-friendly application that aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use Indian Sign Language (ISL) and those who may not understand or be familiar with it. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize gestures made in ISL and translates them into text or speech in real-time.

This repository houses the source code for the Indian Sign Language Translator application. The project provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly. Whether you are a sign language user or someone eager to learn and communicate with the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, this application will help foster inclusivity and accessibility.
